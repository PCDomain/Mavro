### Frontend

The frontend is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The key features include:
- **Components**: Modular, reusable pieces of UI.
- **State Management**: Manage the state of the application using hooks.
- **Styling**: Styled using Bootstrap for a responsive design.

## Project Story

The idea for the Task Manager App came from the need to efficiently manage tasks and improve productivity. The project started as a simple to-do list application and evolved into a comprehensive task management tool. Throughout the development process, various challenges were encountered and overcome, such as integrating the frontend and backend and optimizing the database queries.

### Challenges Overcome

- **Database Optimization**: Optimized the database queries to handle large amounts of data efficiently.
- **Frontend-Backend Integration**: Successfully integrated the React frontend with the Django backend, ensuring smooth communication between the two.

### Future Improvements
